# Linebreakers Setup and Sound Check

* Install Mixing Station on your phone.
* Charge all the USB wireless kit (transmitters & receivers)
* Fresh AA batteries in Dylan's AKG transmitters.
* Fresh batteries in active instruments.

## 1: Stage Layout & Places

Work out where everybody will stand. Mark places on stage with A4 sheets & sharpies so everybody knows where their spot is. Figure out the best place to put the Behringer desk and wifi access point (easy cable runs for everybody)
## 2: Set Out Your Own Gear - NO CABLES

Set up your own pedals, FX, stands, guitar. If you need a mic, get a mic. If you need a mic stand, get a mic stand. Set them all where you want them. 

**Don't connect anything yet.**

Then, get EVERYTHING off the stage that isn't staying there. Cases, bags, jackets.
## 3: Plug it all in

Find a power socket. If you don't have one, find a member of the venue crew and ask for one.

Connect microphones to your mic input on the Behringer desk.

Connect instruments to your assigned input on the Behringer.

Channel assignments are in the Mixing Station software.

*Dylan: plug in Laptop HDMI and check audio/video sync.*
## 4: Get Your Monitor Mix Right

Dylan will play the Linebreakers Sound Check Loop on the laptop channels.

AUX channels

* Put in your in-ear monitors (IEMs)
* Set your receiver to your channel
* Check you can hear your voice and your instrument
* If you can't hear yourself, talk to your mix owner


| AUX | Channel | Mix Owner | Shared With  |
| --- | ------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 1   | 1       | Dylan     | Heather, Eli |
| 2   | 2       | Vagif     | Kevlin       |
| 3   | 3       | Hannes    |              |
| 4   | 4       | Rendle    |              |


## 5: Front of House Mix

Engineer (or whoever's driving the console) sets levels and EQ for each instrument in turn.

THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU STAND STILL, KEEP QUIET, PAY ATTENTION, AND DON'T MAKE A NOISE UNLESS SOMEBODY TELLS YOU TO - AND WHEN YOU START PLAYING, YOU KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ENGINEER SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN THEY ASK YOU TO STOP. HANNES.
## 6: After Soundcheck

Wireless gear switched off. FOH mix muted on the console.

## 20 MINUTES TO SHOWTIME

* Band all "backstage". Don't go back to your room for a little sleep.
* We might start early. Be ready.
* You're standing around doing nothing so if anything happens we're all right there ready to deal with it.
* Instrument off stage with you so you can check the final tuning BEFORE going on stage

## SHOWTIME

* IEMs *in* and *on*
* Guitar wireless on
* If your instrument's wired, carry it on stage with you when we go on and plug it in quick.
* **Walk-on music:** Laptop/PA plays Hotei "Battle Without Honour Or Humanity"* 
* Start recording to the USB stick on the Behringer (in Mixing Station > Playback)
* When it finishes, we walk on stage and launch straight into the first song

## TEARDOWN

1. Take out IEMs, turn off transmitters, switch off wireless gear.
2. Instruments off stage, in cases, so they don't get damaged.
3. Disconnect all cables. Coil neatly and pile at the front of the stage.
4. Fold down mic stands, laptop stands, keyboard stands.

Once everything is folded down, coiled and neat, pack it into the cases/boxes. Then cases & boxes go to the car and we're done.
