```lyrics
Make it work, make it run,
And when your code is done,
Share it with everyone,
MIT, GPL, 
Choosing can be hell,
But any’s better than none,

Keep your license open,
And make sure it's watertight

Exercise, open rights,
Understand, software isn’t contraband

Volunteers, are our peers,
We need their ideas,
If this thing’s gonna work,
If you’re rude, or misconstrued,
Check your attitude,
Maybe you’re being the jerk

Keep your mind wide open,
We’re not here to start a fight,

Exercise, open rights,
Understand, this is not the promised land

When my laptop goes to sleep, I’ll trust the world my source to keep
If I've corrupted all my files, I’ll just download and recompile,

Don’t run Windows, don’t use a Mac,
GNU/Linux on your stack,
Open source on your machine,
In your kernel, on your screen

Exercise, open rights,
Take a stand,
Exercise, open rights,
Understand, software isn’t contraband

```
