## How to book The Linebreakers

**TL;DR: Book us all to speak at your conference. Give us a proper stage, PA system, and an
audience who like loud rock music full of nerdy jokes. We'll do the rest.**

So you're running some sort of tech event. A conference,
a geek festival, your company's having a tech day, that kind of
thing, and you think our band would make a good addition to your
event. Here's how to make that happen.

## First: Are You Sure?

We're a loud rock band. We've played gigs in conference halls,
offices, theatres, but our best shows are in clubs and bars,
later in the evening, when everybody's had a chance to take their
laptop back to the hotel, shower, grab some food, have a drink,
and they're in the mood for a party.

If you want an hour of polite background music while people drink
wine and eat canapÃ©s, we are not the band for your event. Sorry.

If you want a loud rock show, and you've got a venue and
an audience that are up for it, here's how it works.

## Tech Rider and Requirements

Please take a look at our <a href="/rider">tech rider</a>. This
outlines what you'll need to provide and what we'll need at the venue
to be able to do the show.

## Book Us as Speakers

This band exists because a bunch of talented performers kept
bumping into each other at the same tech events and eventually
figured since we were all there anyway we might as well put a
band together. Some of us are at those events because we're
professional speakers who make our living from keynotes and workshops.
Some of us are developer advocates who do conferences as part of
our job. Some of us just like going places and meeting people.
We're all experienced speakers who can deliver sessions on a
range of topics related to software development, architecture,
the web, and more.

Check out <a href="/people/">who we are</a> to see the kind of sessions
we offer and the sort of events we've all spoken at.

Just so we're clear: if it gets to the point where we've agreed who's
coming and when, you are not inviting us to <em>submit</em>. You are
inviting us to <em>speak</em>. Don't tell us how much you love
the show, ask everybody to put talks in Sessionize and then reject half
of them three months later. That's not cool.

## What Does It Cost?

You can look at this two ways: we're a *really* expensive band, or we're
a very cost-effective way to get some first-class presenters, maybe
a keynote or two, *and* a party show.

At a bare minimum, be prepared to cover travel and accommodation
costs for everybody you're bringing in.

Many of us are keynote speakers who usually charge several thousand
euros (or pounds, or dollars) to speak at an event. How much we
charge to speak at <em>your</em> event depends on who you are,
what kind of event it is, whether we get to visit somewhere fun,
who else is going to be there, and if anybody else is making serious
money out of it.

If you're a community event or a non-profit, we'll probably
do it for airfare & hotel. If you're charging â‚¬1800 a ticket and
sponsored by Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, then we expect to get paid.

## Who Do We Book?

First, you need <a href="/people#dylanbeattie">Dylan Beattie</a>. No Dylan, no show.
If you just book Dylan, you'll get two hours of heavy rock music,
with live vocals and guitar and everything else coming from playbacks,
and it'll be a great show because he's a professional, dammit, but deep
inside he'll be sad 'cos his friends aren't there.

Then there's <a href="/people#heather-downing">Heather Downing</a>,
<a href="/people#mark-rendle">Mark Rendle</a>, <a href="/people#vagif-abilov">Vagif Abilov</a>,
<a href="/people#hannes-lowette">Hannes Lowette</a>,
and <a href="/people#eli-holderness">Eli Holderness.</a> They each add a
unique musical facet to the show, so if you want to add disco, pop-punk,
Britpop, Taylor Swift, and Adele to the mix, best invite them along too.

Then there's our special guest guitar trio:
<a href="/people#kevlin">Kevlin Henney</a>,
<a href="/people#alex-dunn">Alex Dunn</a>, and
<a href="/people#max-arshinov">Max Arshinov</a>.
They're great players, great speakers, and having them along
makes for a great show, but if you don't have the budget -- or
the stage space! -- for the whole gang, we understand.
