```lyrics
Hello, Helpdesk! How are you today?
A problem with the internet, you say?
Says here that your Google has gone weird?
Let's check that your browser cache is cleared

Turn it off and on again,
Check the power supply,
It worked, but now it's gone again,
One more thing that we can try,

Press Control and try again,
It works, we don't know why,
System is alive again?
Well, thank you for calling, goodbye!

Keyboard probably riddled with disease
Crumbs and coffee spilled between the keys,
Emails backed up on the system drive,
They've been there since Windows 95,

CHORUS

Laptops, servers, tablets, phones and mice,
Just don't mention bring your own device,
And when I think I've finally seen it all,
I'll wipe away the tears and reinstall
```
