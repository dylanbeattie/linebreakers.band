<h3>The Linebreakers</h3>
<blockquote>Telling a programmer there's already a library for that is like telling a songwriter there's already a song
	about love. But why
	would you write a song about love when you could write a song about programming?</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Linebreakers</strong> is the world's greatest internet comedy classic rock disco alt punk covers band.
</p>
<p>Live covers of classic tunes, from ABBA and Adele to Metallica and Nirvana, with the lyrics lovingly reworked to
	see how many stupid jokes about programming, technology and the web will fit into a four-minute pop song.
</p>
<blockquote>The tech industryâ€™s answer to Weird Al Yankovic</blockquote>
<p>Since 2016, Linebreakers has been entertaining conference audiences and meetups all over the world, from
	Kyiv to Kansas City, from Sydney to Siberia. We've played at the Copenhagen Developers Festival, NDC, BuildStuff,
	DevSum, GOTO,
	YOW!, DotNext, CodeFest, and many more.</p>
