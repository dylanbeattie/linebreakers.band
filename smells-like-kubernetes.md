```lyrics
Code is all done, the tests are green,
But it only works on my machine,
Config too hard to replicate,
Afraid to run OS update,

I/O, I/O, I/O, I/O, oh no,
I/O, I/O, I/O, I/O, oh no,

Overwrite's out, it's too dangerous,
So we run it, in containers,
Architecture is outrageous,
So we run it, in containers,

The code I write, it's not the best,
I'm even worse at writing tests,
And I'm the best one, on the team,
That's just the way it's always been

I/O, I/O, I/O, I/O, oh no,
I/O, I/O, I/O, I/O, oh no,

Overwrite's out, it's too dangerous,
So we run it, in containers,
Architecture, is outrageous,
So we run it, in containers,

Kubernetes, are you ready
Security, by committee?

You don't need to authenticate,
You just connect and life is great,
I'm sure that on deployment day,
They'll put a firewall in the way

I/O, I/O, I/O, I/O, oh no,
I/O, I/O, I/O, I/O, oh no,
