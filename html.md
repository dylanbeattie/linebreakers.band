W3C, RFC
JIRA ticket and a style guide,
I deploy with FTP,
Run it all on the client side,

Don’t need Ruby, don’t need Rails,
Ain’t nothing running on my stack,
Hardwired for web scale,
Yeah, I’m gonna bring the 90s back,

I’m shipping H T M L 
H T M L
I’m shipping H T M L
H T M L

No logins, no trackers,
No cookie banners to ignore,
I ain’t afraid of no hackers,
Just the occasional 404,

They hatin’, what I do,
But that’s ‘cos they don’t understand,
Mark it up, break it down,
Remember to escape your ampersands
```
