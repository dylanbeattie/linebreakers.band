(intro: vocal + laptop synth pads)
Midnight takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart, baby
Give back your heart, yeah

(Riff: G A C D D G A G C A)

My dreams hold diamond nightmares
Salvation holds the sea
The night holds silent echoes
Your love is meaningless to me

C                     D
Rock my dreams like a lovestruck smile
Am
Rock my dreams with your love, your love
C                     D
Rock the night like a switchblade missile
Am
Rock the night with your love, your love.
