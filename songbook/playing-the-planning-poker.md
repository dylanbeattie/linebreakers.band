(Intro: Am)

Am
We’re into ceremonies, stand ups and story cards,
Am
Don’t laugh, it isn’t funny, SCRUM makes it really hard,

Am
Two years with no deployments, just more bureaucracy,
Am
Sat through a lot of meetings, hired a consultancy

     Dm                                 Em
They made us use a spreadsheet to track every change we made,
     F                          G
They told us scaled agile would take away the pain,
      E7
For a thousand pounds a day,

Am                 G                    Am
No more estimates, playing the planning poker,
Am                       G                    Am
We don’t innovate, we’re playing the planning poker
Am                     G               Am
Backlog is a mess, our stories are mediocre,
Am                       G                    Am
Don’t investigate, we’re playing the planning poker

(Guitar solo - 4 bars)

G                    Am
Playing the planning poker
G                    Am
Playing the planning poker

(interlude)

Am NC
  Set up a new committee to define our coding style,
Am
First up: tabs or spaces? Gonna be here for a while 

   Dm                     Em
At every retrospective we review the status quo,
    F                             G
But nothing ever changes, 'cos we know just for show,
    E7
And around and round we go…

CHORUS

(Guitar solo - 8 bars)
