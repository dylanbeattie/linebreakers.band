```lyrics
Trying to keep track of a username,
Seven calls back to a hidden page IFRAME
Trying to keep track of a username,
Nobody knows how it got like this,
Anything goes when it's always been a mess,
 
And nobody knows how it got like this,
I said nobody knows how it got like this,
Now it's all down, now it's all down tonight,
Never thought I'd see a cookie crash a whole website,
  
Well, somebody told me the service locator
should use an adaptor to talk to the data proxy provider,
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture

Ready, let's roll out a new release,
What do you mean, there's a seven day code freeze?
  
And nobody knows how it got like this,
I said nobody knows how it got like this,
Now it's all down, now it's all down tonight,
Never thought I'd see a cookie crash a whole website,

Well, somebody told me the service locator
should use an adaptor to talk to the data proxy provider,
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture

Well, somebody told me the service locator
should use an adaptor to talk to the data proxy provider,
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture
