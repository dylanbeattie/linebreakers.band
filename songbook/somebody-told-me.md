[Intro] Am - Dm - F - Am

Am
Trying to keep track of a username
                                 Dm      F
Seventeen calls to a hidden page IFRAME
    Am
I'm trying to keep track of a username
So everything goes in a trace like this
                                      Dm     F
And everyone knows it's always been a mess

      Am
We're not even close to replacing this
So everything goes in a trace like this
F                    G                   Am
  Now it's all down, now it's all down tonight
F                    G                   Am
Never thought I'd see a cookie crash a whole website

               Am                  F
Well, somebody told me the user provider
               G                   E             Am
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder
                F                  G                E
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture, 

Am
Eighty controllers, a hundred views
                                              Dm     F
Check the console, turns out none of them are used

          Am
And we're not even close to replacing this
I said we're not even close to replacing this
F                    G                   Am
  Now it's all down, now it's all down tonight
F                                      G  
Never thought I'd see a cookie crash a whole website

Am                  F
Well, somebody told me the user provider
               G                   E             Am
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder
                F                  G               
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture, 
             E
a taking it, taking it down

F      G       Dm
Tables with no keys
  C      Dm    F
Behind repositories
              Am    G   F
And yet still somehow
E                     G
No-one ever questions why...

Am                  F
Well, somebody told me the user provider
               G                   E             Am
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder
                F                  G               
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture, 
             E
a taking it, taking it down

Am                  F
Well, somebody told me the user provider
               G                   E             Am
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder
                F                  G               
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture, 
             E
a taking it, taking it down

Am                  F
Well, somebody told me the user provider
               G                   E             Am
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder
                F                  G               
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture, 
             E
a taking it, taking it down
