```lyrics
You used to build all your own machines
You’d spec out your PCs with parts from magazines,
You liked the noise of a server room,
When every box in every rack was finely-tuned***
But now it isn't true, now everything is new
And all you've learned has overturned, I'm telling you

Don't go wasting your resources
Run in the cloud with me

It started slow, now it’s everywhere,
First the machines, then the network, now it's all software
Not the career that you had planned,
A grown-up engineer with your own anti-static band,***
You feel a kind of fear, when you don't have your gear
But now it’s time to swallow pride, I’ll make it clear

Don't go wasting your resources
Run in the cloud with me
Don't accumulate your losses
Run in the cloud with me

You’ve run a few startups on the way,
They didn’t last very long once you had bills to pay,
You used to think you were sensible
You'll grow accustomed to server rooms being dispensable
'Cause everything is new
And you should have a clue
And all you've learned has overturned
What can we do

Don't go wasting your resources
Run in the cloud with me
Don't accumulate your losses
Run in the cloud with me
