Intro:
Dm A     | Dm A Dm        | A#   | A    |
Dm C/E F | A#    C  C7    | F    |      |

Dm A.    | Dm A  Dm       | A#   | A    |
Dm C/E F | A#    C  C7    | F    |      |

Dm       |                |.     |      |

Dm
You used to build all your own machines
                                        C
You’d spec out your PCs with parts from magazines,
Dm
You liked the noise of a server room,
                                 C
When every box in every rack was finely tuned
    Dm                     A7
But now it isn't true, now everything is new
    Dm                     A7              Dm           G
And all you've learned has overturned, I'm telling you

Dm    A  Dm  A    Dm   G  Gb   A
Don't go was-ting your re-sour-ces
Dm  C/E F  Gm    C7   F
Run in the cloud with me


Dm
It started slow, now it’s everywhere,
                                               C
First the machines, then the network, now it's all software
Dm
  Not the career that you had planned,
                                       C
A grown-up engineer with your own anti-static band,***
You feel a kind of fear, when you don't have your gear
But now it’s time to swallow pride, I’ll make it clear

Don't go wasting your resources
Run in the cloud with me
Don't accumulate your losses
Run in the cloud with me

You’ve run a few startups on the way,
They didn’t last very long once you had bills to pay,
You used to think you were sensible
You'll grow accustomed to server rooms being dispensable
'Cause everything is new
And you should have a clue
And all you've learned has overturned
What can we do

Don't go wasting your resources
Run in the cloud with me
Don't accumulate your losses
Run in the cloud with me

```

[Verse 1]
Dm
   I wasn't jealous before we met
                                C
   Now every woman I see is a potential threat
Dm
   And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
                                              C
   You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
[Pre-Chorus 1]
    Dm
But now it isn't true    A7
Now everything is new    Dm                   A7
And all I've learned has o  -  verturned  Dm        G
I beg of you
[Chorus 1]
Dm    A   Dm A    Dm     A#  A
Don't go  wasting your e  -  mo - tion
Dm  C/E F    A#  C7 F
Lay all your love on me

[Interlude 1]

[Verse 2]
Dm
   It was like shooting a sitting duck
                                         C
   A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
Dm
   I still don't know what you've done with me
                                         C
   A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
[Pre-Chorus 2]
  Dm
I feel a kind of fear     A7
When I don't have you near  Dm           A7
Unsatisfied, I skip  my pride  Dm          G
I beg you dear
[Chorus 2]
Dm    A   Dm A    Dm     A#  A
Don't go  wasting your e  -  mo - tion
Dm  C/E F    A#  C7 F
Lay all your love on me
Dm    A  Dm A    Dm      A#  A
Don't go  sharing your de  -  vo - tion
Dm  C/E F    A#  C7 F
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 3]
Dm
   I've had a few little love affairs
                                               C
   They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
Dm
   I used to think I was sensible
                                        C
   It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
[Pre-Chorus 3]
       Dm
'Cause everything is new     A7
 And everything is you     Dm                   A7
 And all I've learned has o  -  verturned      Dm      G
 What can I do
[Final chorus]
Dm    A   Dm A    Dm     A#  A
Don't go  wasting your e  -  mo - tion
Dm  C/E F    A#  C7 F
Lay all your love on me
Dm    A   Dm A    Dm      A#  A
Don't go  sharing your de  -  vo - tion
Dm  C/E F    A#  C7 F
Lay all your love on me

[Outro]
(repeat to fade)
Dm    A   Dm A    Dm     A#  A
Don't go  wasting your e  -  mo - tion
Dm  C/E F    A#  C7 F
Lay all your love on me
Dm    A   Dm A    Dm      A#  A
Don't go  sharing your de  -  vo - tion
Dm  C/E F    A# C7 F
Lay all your love on me
