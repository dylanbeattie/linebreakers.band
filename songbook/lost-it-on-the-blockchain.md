```lyrics
I bet you’re wondering all about,
This new currency that’s coming out,
And I can’t deny the possibility,
That it could mean profitability,

I did all the work and I shared the proof,
And now my power bill is through the roof,

Don’t you know, I lost it on the blockchain,
My money’s never coming back again,
Ooh yeah, I lost it on the blockchain,
Watched my savings goin' down the drain, honey honey, yeah

It seemed to good to be true,
But I heard about it from this guy I knew,
He told me all about the crypto code,
Behind the dark web and the Silk Road,
I signed up online, put in all of my cash,
Nobody told me it was gonna crash,

Yeah, I lost it on the blockchain,
My money’s never coming back again,
Don’t you know I lost it on the blockchain,
Watched my savings going down the drain, honey honey, yeah

Well, I divested my portfolio,
Bitcoin, ethereum and monero,
I was gonna stick it to the man,
But now I’m living in the back of my van,
I even bought some dogecoin, oh yeah, honey,
Don’t you know that's dog-based internet money,

Ooh yeah, I lost it on the blockchain,
My money’s never coming back again,
Ooh yeah, I lost it on the blockchain,
Watching my savings going down the drain, honey, honey,

SOLO

Ooh yeah, I lost it on the blockchain,
My money’s never coming back again,
Ooh yeah, I lost it on the blockchain,
Watching my savings going down the drain, honey, honey,
