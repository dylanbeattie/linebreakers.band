```lyrics
My laptop updates, to Windows 10,
Connect to my phone, but now it’s incompatible,
Read all the news about the IoT,
 Turns out that ten point three can cause connection dropping,

I update my phone, my tablet and my car,
If you can’t take the pace, get  out of the race,
I’m sure it wasn’t this way, back in the good old days,
I’m not stuck in the past, I’m just reverse compatible

Running updates, constantly,
On my laptop, my TV, and my phone,
But these are my own devices,
So leave them alone

Buy a new game, time to have some fun,
The only catch is there’s a ten gig patch,
I’d like to wait, but it’s a forced update,
So I poke at some code, while I watch it load

I was a lonely boy, no friends, no toys,
In a world of my own, with a dial-up modem,
Yes, my grades were a mess, but on the B B S,
I was always online, I was system admin,

Running updates, constantly,
On my laptop, my TV, and my phone,
But these are my own devices,
So leave them alone

I was faced with a choice, at a critical stage,
Do we delay the release, and risk the shareholder's rage?
But in the back of my head, I knew the bugs could wait,
We can deal with them later in an app update…

It’s not a crime when you miss, a thing or two,
A unit test, a code review,
You’re still at work, it’s late at night,
Do you get it done, or get it right?
Turn off your PC, too tired to cook,
Poke at your phone, click some food,
Who cares if the code is looking five by five,
We can fix it with an update after we go live,

Running updates, constantly,
On my laptop, my TV, and my phone,
But these are my own devices,
So leave them alone
