Chords are D / A / Bm / G, but there’s a nice arpeggio pattern based around Dsus2/Asus4/Bmadd11/G6/9

Watch out for the key change for the final chorus.

Intro: (w/arpeggio)

Dsus2  Asus4/E  Bm  G

Dsus2
We were nearly done when I first saw you
  G
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
                Bm
You're standing there
                         G
And you're talking about middleware
Dsus2
Friday night, getting ready to shut down
G
See us getting ready to head out of town
         Bm             Asus4     A
About to go, little did I know
       G                            Asus4
That'd you'd already sold it to the highest bidder
   Bm                           Dsus2
Despite the fact we hadn't even built it yet
               G
And now you're hoping for a miracle
Asus4                 Bm     G   Asus4
begging my team don't go...          and you said

D
Come on, just tell me, how long is it gonna take?
Asus4       A
CFO told me it'd be a piece of cake
Bm
How about this time we don't write any tests?
G5                  A                     Dsus2
It's a user story, maybe just say yes?

   Dsus2
So we hack up a technical preview
G
Just to see what we can make it do
           Bm
You put it live
                         Asus4            A
Now we're running ‘round fighting fires,

     G                           Asus4
'Cos we were racking up all that technical debt
       Bm                       Dsus2
I knew that it would backfire and we'd soon regret it
          G
we should never have agreed
          Asus4                Bm    G   Asus4
and I was telling you, no, no, no,             and I said

D
Don't you know, maybe, we should never have begun?
Asus4               A
Six weeks in and we can't even get it to run,
Bm
We might be pros but this isn't our process
G5                  A
It's a user story, why did we say yes...

D
Don't you know, maybe, all our concerns were real
Asus4                   A
This is turning out to    be a bad deal,
Bm
There's no way we'll make it out of this mess
G5                 A
It's a user story, why did we say yes...

[Solo]
| D    | D    | Asus4   | A   |Bm  |Bm  | G5   | A   |

(A)               Bm      G5                D                  A
   Getting so frustrating   Wondering which way this was going to go
               Bm      G5          D                 A
I got tired of waiting   Called a meeting with the CEO, and I said…
D
Listen up, there's something we need to talk about
Asus4             A
New product owner just isn't working out
Bm
We gave it a shot, but something's gotta give…
    G5               A
She looked at me and said with a grin: "I...

(key change!)

E
fired him yesterday, he’s never coming back.
B
The deal is off, now, let's get back on track.
C#m
Take a long weekend, unwind, decompress
A                  B                   E
It's a user story, maybe just say yes,

(E)  B   C#m    A  B   E
