```lyrics
One day you're gonna have to pay
and it's gonna be an awful mess,
You found a plugin on the ground
and installed it into your Wordpress,
You were warned off by everybody,
but nevertheless,
you doubled down

Rootkit, you should have thought of it
but you didn't even have a clue,
Malware, you didn't have a care,
and now they're coming after you,
I don't believe that anybody
does the things you do
and sticks around

And all my exploit signatures are syncing,
and all the lights along my front are blinking,
There's so many packets that are trying to get through,
that I disallow,

Because it's true,
I'm going to be the one that saves you
'Cos after all,
I'm your firewall.

One day you're gonna have to pay
and it's gonna be an awful mess,
You found a plugin on the ground
and installed it into your Wordpress,
You were warned off by everybody,
but nevertheless,
you doubled down

And I got no idea what you were thinking,
But all the lights along my front are blinking,
There's so many packets that are trying to get through,
that I disallow,

Because it's true,
I'm gonna be the one that saves you,
And after all,
I'm your firewall
