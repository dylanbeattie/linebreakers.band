C                        Em
Ah, look at all the data contexts
C                        Em
Ah, look at all the data contexts
Em
Entity Framework, reads all the rows from a
                 C               Em
database on your machine, into a stream
Em
All of the memory, memory you bought so your
                C
API wouldn’t be slow, where did it go?

Em7          Em6	          C/E               Em
All the data contexts, where do they all come from,
Em7          Em6	          C/E         Em
All the data contexts, what are we doing wrong?
Em
Entity tracker, working so hard to detect
               C                   Em
any changes in state, Intention is great
Em
What's going to happen when there are multiple
                          C                       Em
threads with concurrent up-dates? Should they all wait?
Em7          Em6	           C/E        Em
All the data contexts, for every new request,
Em7          Em6	          C/E               Em
All the data contexts, we don’t know how to test?
Em7          Em6	          C/E               Em
All the lazy loading, we don’t know what it’s for,
Em7          Em6	          C/E               Em
It can’t be that important, it’s not in EF Core

C    Bm7     E7                    Am              Am/G   F
TLA,      I don’t know what you're trying to say,
           G7             F    C
Wish these acronyms would go a-way,
  Am         D7       F   C
I can’t make sense of T L A
C    Bm7     E7         Am    Am/G   F
FAQ,     V-P-N,    TFT, CPU,
      G7                 F        C
Maybe they all mean some-thing to you,
    Am        D7       F         C
For what it’s worth, I hope they do,


Bm7 E7  Am Am/G  F      Dm    G   C
Y   2   K, V     B, I O T and S D K,
Bm7 E7  Am Am/G  F      Dm    G   C
T   C   P  I     P  U D P and 2 F A
C    Bm7     E7      Am  Am/G  F
RPC,       XML over HTTP,
       G7        F C
ASCII, EBCDIC or PHP
  Am    D7     F C
FILO, FIFO and FTP,

Bm7  E7  Am  Am/G  F   Dm       G   C
When the A   M     I IAM’s gone M-I-A,
Bm7  E7  Am  Am/G  F     Dm      G   C
So   say R   I     P I P O   and S-L-A

F      C        Bb      F       Dm     Gm       Bb         C
At the place we used to work, a new de-veloper joined the team
F       C        Bb    F    Dm     Gm          Bb   C
And he told us all a-bout   how to virtualize, a ma-chine
F          C         Bb     F    Dm       Gm       Bb         C
The server fans were really loud and some-body had nicked the screen,
F     C        Bb     F          Dm      Gm           Bb   C
So we moved it to the cloud, and now the monitors are ever green
F               C                C                F
We all run on a virtual machine, virtual machine, virtua l machine
F               C                C                F
We all run on a virtual machine, virtual machine, virtual machine
        F       C         Bb     F     Dm     Gm      Bb    C
They’re still a-fraid, to virtua-lise, in the land of enter-prise,
F        C     Bb       F     Dm     Gm          Bb   C
Hear the fans, begin to spin  (brass band interlude)

F               C                C                F
We all run on a virtual machine, virtual machine, virtua l machine
F               C                C                F
We all run on a virtual machine, virtual machine, virtual machine

C7                      F7
Asked the girl what she wanted to be
C7                  F7
And she said "Baby, can't you see?
C7                           F7
I want to see my code run on every screen,
G5
And you can do something for me…

Am                   F7   Am                           F7
Baby you can port my app, multi platform’s where it’s at,
Am                   D        G          C         F   G
Baby you can port my app, and maybe I’ll hire you


C7                      F7
I asked that girl: "Isn't iOS enough?"
C7                  F7
And she said:  "Boy, you don't get this stuff
C7                           F7
Working for hipsters is all very fine
        G5
But you gotta run on Android to have a good time"

Am                   F7   Am                         F7
Baby you can port my app, multi platform’s where it’s at
Am                   D        G          C         F   G
Baby you can port my app and maybe I'll hire you
