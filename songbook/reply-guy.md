```lyrics
Verse 1
I'm all up in your social feed,
Waiting to do my evil deed,
Ans'ring posts I don't even read,
Think I'm omniscient
I just like to explain to you,
Things you thought you already knew,
I don't care who I'm speaking to,
I'm just so prescient

Chorus
So you're just a girl,
Like to dance and play girl,
Lipstick and hairspray girl,
You don't know the way girl,
I'm a smart guy,
Knowledge to impart guy,
According to this chart guy,
Actually sweetheart guy,
I’m Reply Guy… duh

Verse 2
I see your new post as I scroll,
Waiting so I can play my role,
I got nothing to do but troll,
I love to needle ya,
I like to tell you you are wrong,
It makes me feel so big and strong,
I don’t think girls like you belong,
On social media

Post-Chorus
I’m Reply Guy, duh
I’m only brave on my keypad

Bridge
I like when you get mad,
I think I’m super bad here on my phone,
You say you’re blocking me?
You’re mean, I don’t see why that’s fair,
And maybe that’s why I’m gonna die alone

Outro
I’m Reply Guy
I’m, I’m Reply Guy,
```
