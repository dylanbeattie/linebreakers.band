I think I'm down and demotivated
I'm in a living hell, so isolated

I know I'm overdue for a vacation
Instead I'm stuck on this integration

I can't see the new DB,
Yeah, I can't see the new DB

Query it,
They won't let me query it,
They won't let me push to git, 
Can't ship a single bit,

Our team is burning out,
Our team is burning out,
Can't turn this thing around,
Can't get a release out

It's taking longer than you predicted
But you don't like being contradicted
Now that we know we're screwed, cancel vacation
But never dream of raising compensation
