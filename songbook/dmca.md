Young man, there's no need to feel down,
         C#m
I said, young man, you've been browsing around,
        A
I said, young man, what's that website you've found, With those
B  A   B  A   B   B
Hi-def mo-vie downloads,

E
Young man, look at all of those files, I said,
C#m
young man, you'll be here for a while, you can
A
download, anything you desire,
          B  A   B  A   B   B    B B B B B
Till your router catches fire...           You're violating the...


E                       C#m
D M C A , violating the D M C A,
         F#m
They got everything, you can find it online, you can
 B7
download it any time

E                      C#m
D M C A, violating the D M C A,
        F#m
All the new DVDs, special interest movies,
       B7
even Taylor Swift MP3s,

Young man, well you couldn't resist, I said
Young man, now your name's on a list, I said,
Young man, got your cease and desist,
But you got to know this one thing,
No man, ever serves any time, I said
Young man, maybe you'll pay a fine,
And tomorrow, you will be back online,
You'll be downloading day and night,

Young man, back when I was your age, It was
Usenet, not a link on a page,
alt dot binaries, it was where we could go,
If we wanted things to download,
Napster, came along with a splash, record
Labels, scared of losing their cash,
Got it shut down, by the D M C A, So we
moved to the Pirate Bay
