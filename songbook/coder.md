```lyrics
I did my best to fix it,
When the text would not align,
Up to the centre of the viewport,
Like in the Photoshop design,
And I wonder if it matters,
That I don’t know what rems are for,
Close your tags,
Clear your floats
Underscore

Are we coder?
Or web designer?
My style’s !important,
My font is bold.
And I’m on IE
Putting styles inline… er,
Are we coder?
Or web designer?

I’ve worked with Sass and Stylus
Rewritten everything in Less
I tried Base and Pure and Bootstrap
But I just made a fucking mess
So goodbye to the browser
It was never meant to be
Quit UI
Go backend
I’m learning PHP

Will your layout be alright?
When your divs are floated right?
There is no standard we’re all using
Why are selectors so confusing?
```
