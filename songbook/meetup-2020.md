[Verse]
              E
Oh we were all looking for things to inspire us,
     E
When it was all shut down by coronavirus,
               A                A
Now we're in lockdown, lockdown, and nobody is coming round,
          E
We've taken all the regulations to heart
  E
We got to stay at least a metre apart,
          A               A
Wear a mask, wash your hands, say goodbye to all your plans.


[Pre-Chorus]
           Bm
Oh, do you recall?
The jet lag and long haul,
The world felt very small,
Then it all slowed to a crawl,
                             E
You know I really missed you all...

[Chorus]
And I said,
A
Let’s all meet up in two thousand twenty.
C#m                               F#m
Turn on your webcam and your microphone
                                Bm                 E
We can still get together, even though we're home alone,
A
Let's all pretend that this isn't weird,
C#m                                 F#m
Certainly better than drinking on our own,

                               Bm                  E
You might lose inhibitions but you won’t lose your phone


[Verse 2]
I'm trying to keep up with the news,
But all the guidance leaves me scared and confused,
I've got the melancholy corona blues,
And I've forgotten how to put on my shoes
Remember when I said I wanted a break,
That all the travel might have been a mistake,
Well now we're all grounded, it's not as much fun as it sounded,

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Outro]
A
What do you do on a lockdown Monday?
C#m
Same thing as Saturday and Sunday?
F#m           Bm
Everything blurs into one day,
ooh ah ha ooh hoo hoooo hoo
A
What do you do on a lockdown Monday?
C#m
Same thing as Saturday and Sunday?
F#m           Bm
Everything blurs into one day,
ooh ah ha ooh hoo hoooo hoo, hoo ah hoo hoooo hooo!
