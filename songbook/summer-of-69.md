```lyrics
Thunder of the Saturn engines,
Fire trail across the sky,
Heading for the final frontier,
Back in the summer of 69

Heroes of a generation,
Clean-cut all-American smiles,
Drifting in the silent darkness,
A quarter of a million miles

Landing on another world,
A moment that would last forever,
Watching the flag unfurl,
A moment we were all together,
It was a giant leap for mankind

From the depths of our darkest hour,
Came the key to our great escape,
Some days we’re the falling angel,
Some days we’re the rising ape,

Landing on another world,
A moment that would last forever,
Watching the flag unfurl;,
For a moment we were all together,
It was a giant leap for mankind

(Bridge)
Ever since the dawn of time,
We have longed to slip,
The surly bonds of earth,
And touch the face of heaven,

All we left was flags and footprints,
Our celestial calling card,
To remind us we choose to do things,
Not ‘cos they’re easy, but because they are hard,

Landing on another world,
A moment that would last forever,
Watching the flag unfurl,
Humanity was all together,
It was a giant leap for mankind

Back in the summer of 69
It was the summer of 69, oh yeah...
