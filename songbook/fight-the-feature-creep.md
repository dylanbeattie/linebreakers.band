[Intro]
Cm

Cm                     Gm
There's a requirement, on top of my stack,
Bb                       Gm             Bb
Seeking enlightenment, I message you on Slack,
Cm             Gm
I don't see why we're waiting to go live
Bb                                    Gm                     Bb
Our funding ran out months ago, we're struggling to survive

Cm                    Gm
Nobody needs all this shit you're specifying
Bb                              Gm             Bb
Developers are burning out, the CFO is crying
Cm                      Gm
All these requirements, sat here on my stack,
Bb                               Gm                       Bb
No way we'll ship them all while we're still in the black

[Pre-Chorus]

Ab              Bb                   Gm
The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
             Ab                          Bb Ab
You keep on saying, we’ve gotta have it all,
             Bb                       Gm
The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
             G7#5
I can’t help thinking…

[Chorus]
                     Cm                       Bb
We ought to cut ‘em all
                    (haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
               Ab                         Bb
Fight the feature creep,
                (like a waterfall, features gonna creep)
    (Bb)                Cm           Bb
Right from the start we tried, had a plan
                    (haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
        Ab             Bb
But you say it’s incomplete
                (like a waterfall, features gonna creep)

[Verse]

Cm                 Gm
Maybe I don't know what we should have done,
    Bb                          Gm                    Bb
But our nearest competitor just shipped their version 1,
   Cm                              Gm
It doesn't run on blockchain, scan Facebook for your friends
     Bb                             Gm                 Bb
They hit a million signups in their opening weekend,

Ab              Bb                   Gm
    The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
                    (haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
             Ab                             Ab
You keep on saying, we’ve gotta have it all,
                (like a waterfall, features gonna creep)
             Bb                       Gm
The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
                    (haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
             G7
I can’t help thinking…
                (like a waterfall, features gonna creep)

[Chorus]

                     Cm                       Bb
We ought to cut ‘em all
                    (haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
               Ab                         Bb
Fight the feature creep,
                (like a waterfall, features gonna creep)
    (Bb)                Cm           Bb
Right from the start we tried, had a plan
                    (haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
        Ab             Bb
But you say it’s incomplete
                (like a waterfall, features gonna creep)


[Interlude - Chorus Variation]

(Bb)               Ab    Bb
We ought to cut ‘em all
               Cm     Bb
Fight the feature creep,
                   Ab            Ab
Right from the start we tried, had a plan
           Bb                 Bb
But you say it’s incomplete


[Verse]

N.C.
Cut your road map, cut it to the bone
Nobody cares if we run on Windows Phone
Nobody’s buying, the vision that you sold,
Maybe time to pick up the agile manifesto

[Chorus Variant 2]
 Cm                     Bb
(Haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
                                We ought to cut them all
                     Ab                         Ab             Bb
(Like a waterfall, features gonna creep)
                                We ought to cut them all
   (Bb)               Cm                               Bb
(Haven't got a clue, what is MVP)
                                We ought to cut them all
               Ab                Bb
(Like a waterfall, features gonna creep)
        them all,   them all


[Chorus x 2]
