```lyrics
There once was a dev who wrote in C
Despite a lack of ability,
The costs went up and the word came down,
The developer had to go

Soon may the reckoning come,
He's only here until it runs,
When all the debugging is done,
That developer has to go

With the shipping date two weeks away,
The project plan long gone astray ,
The manager called up to say,
The developer had to go,

CHORUS

He reinvented bubble sort, a
thing that we were always taught, a
program should just hash import, a
simple thing to know

CHORUS

No pointers checked, no malloc()s freed,
That developers' code was bad indeed,
But I think he honestly believed,
His code was good to go,

CHORUS

Now everything is months off track,
We can't go live and we can't go back,
We've overflowed our problem stack,
And don't know where to go

CHORUS

The last I heard, he's still down there,
He's lost his mind and all his hair,
But until he's debugged that codebase,
They'll never let him leave the place,
```
