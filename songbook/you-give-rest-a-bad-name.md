```lyrics
Your API is a hall of shame, 
You give REST a bad name,

This integration-s’going to hell,
You promised me JSON then sent XML,
You say it works, in a RESTful way,
Then your errors come back as 200 OK

Whoa, it’s no surprise,
Method names in URIs,
Your data won’t even deserialise,

Your API, is a hall of shame, 
You give REST a bad name,
It falls apart, and we take the blame,
You give REST a bad name 

Broken methods, missing docs,
Updates fail 'cos of database locks,
Breaking changes, every time,
Your every release takes our system offline,

Whoa, it’s no surprise,
There’s method names in URIs,
Your data won’t even deserialise,
```
