```lyrics
Here comes Johnny, Mr Horton Conway,
Be-bop-a-lula, baby, what I say,
Here comes Johnny, singing I got a game here,
Listen up, here's how you play,

Zero, one, die of isolation,
Two or three, live another day,
Four or more, over-population,
And three is gonna bring you back to life, OK?

You set it up and run the simulation,
And wait to see which cells survive,
When you run the game,
You run the game of life, oooh, you run the game of life...

Here comes Johnny, and he's got a question,
Can you make the game grow indefinitely?
Here comes Gosper, ridin' on a glider,
Generating shapes until infinity,

Zero, one, die of isolation,
Two or three, see another day,
Four or more, over-population,
And three is gonna bring you back to life, OK?

You got a knightship and a lobster and a beacon,
You got a pulser and a load and a beehive,
All in the game,
in the game of life, yeah, in the game of life.
