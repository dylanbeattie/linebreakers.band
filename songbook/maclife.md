```lyrics
The conference is a reference 
for the habitual buyeur of what is known as... MACLIFE!
Infinite Loop can’t be avoided 
if you take a route straight to what is known as MACLIFE!
John’s got Windows 10 
he gets intimidated by the terminal, 
He just likes clicking things MACLIFE
What’s that Linux desktop, 
you should cut down on your hack life, mate, 
get some Apple style

Shiny Apple,
Oh shiny Apple,
We all go, cash in hand,
Cash in hand for their MACLIFE
Know what I mean?

I reboot when I want, except at weekends 
when iTunes rudely crashes with a beachball (MACLIFE)
I sort my dongles out, put on my Apple Watch 
and imagine right-clicking a mouse MACLIFE
I keep my iPhones, I sometimes keep my iPads too, 
it gives me a sense of enormous well-being MACLIFE
And then I'm happy for the rest of my life, 
safe in the knowledge there will always be 
a drawer in my house devoted to them

Shiny Apple,
Oh shiny Apple,
We all go, cash in hand,
Cash in hand for their MACLIFE


It's got nothing to do with Vorsprung durch touchscreen, you know?
and it's not about your personal data going round and round and round (parklife)

Shiny Apple,
Oh shiny Apple,
We all go, cash in hand,
Cash in hand for their MACLIFE

Shiny Apple,
Oh shiny Apple,
We all go, cash in hand,
Cash in hand for their MACLIFE
