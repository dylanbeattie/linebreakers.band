```lyrics
  G     D    Em
A long, long time ago,
Am            C                  Em               D
I wrote in as-sembler, and those op codes used to make me smile
    G           D      Em           Am                 C
I wrote my ‘Hello World’ program, in sixteen kilobytes of RAM
    Em              C                  D
No function calls, no do() or for() or while()
    Em               Am                   Em          Am
I’d sit all night in rapt frustration, trying new optimisations
C        G      Am          C             D
Forgot to sleep or eat, I would not admit defeat
  G       D      Em                 Am             D
Every change caused more confusion, surrounded by my own delusion
G       D       Em                C    D7     G   C G
Finally came to a conclusion, I’d do a big re-write


     G    C         G             D          G            C                 G   D
It’s high time we re-viewed our de-sign, the code behind our system is just too byzantine
G        C                  G           D
We’ll rewrite all the legacy and take it offline,
Em                           A7    Em                       D7
And it’s gonna compile first time, it’s gonna compile first time

G              Am       C              Am
Did you have a BBC or a Commodore or a VIC-20,
Em                  D
eight bits wide and slow as hell
       G         D        Em              Am       C
Or did you start out on the Unix scene, a VMS or a PDP,
     Em               A7         D7
Your own account with email and a shell?
          Em              Am               Em              Am
Well it’s not like anyone really cares, we all got started out somewhere
  C        G     A7                C         D7
A keyboard and a screen, a listing in a maga-zine
   G           D        Em              Am                  C
We typed those games in key by key, con-vinced our code was typo free
    G       D      Em              C      D7      G  C G          D7
But we knew that e-ventually, we’d do the big re-write (I started singing....)

G                             Am              C       Am
Now for ten years, we've been running code in PHP and Rust and Node
    Em                        D          G          D             Em
but that's not how it used to be. When I learned to code it was a different age
Am           C                        Em               A7              D7
Turbo Pascal was all the rage, and we couldn’t wait to install Windows 3
     Em                 Am                Em               Am
Well six-forty-key of    - memory, should be enough for any - body
        C     G       A7              C             D7
And for multi tasking code, we had to run protected mode
          G      D      Em                Am                C
You’d work with your bible by your side, Peter Norton’s MS-DOS guide,
    G        D            Em                      C    D7     G    C   G
But you’d al-ready worked out, deep inside, you’d do a big re-write
        D7
we were singing


G             Am                       C                     Am
Dial up modem straining to upload ‘em, spitting out sites as fast as we could code ‘em
Em                           D
Share price high and rising faaaaaaaast
G      D            Em             Am               C
  Wai -ing for that big IPO; We’re gonna be million-aires, don’t you know?
Em                 A7               D7
I guess it was all just too good to last
    Em                     Am                   Em            Am
We thought the web was the -  promised land, coded our HTM-L by hand,
    C       G      A7              C          D7
But when we put it live, it didn’t work in IE 5
   G          D         Em                  Am             C
We started to feel like we were cursed, the dot com bubble finally burst,
    G           D         Em               C     D7    G       C       G
And then things went from bad to worse: we did a big re-write
           D7
We started singing

    G             Am                 C               Am
Oh, there we were shouting out loud, move everything   to the cloud;
    Em           D
and run on virtu-al machines,
  G      D         Em               Am              C
E-lastic scale to cope with load,   infra structure built on code,
       Em                 A7            D7
though no-one’s sure what devops really means
  Em                    Am              Em                 Am
I sat and I watched the counters climb, wishing I got paid -  overtime
         C     G   A7               C                D7
Then the Mongo D B failed, guess it wasn’t quite web scale
   G        D            Em             Am                C
We lost the whole availa-bility zone, I couldn’t get tech support on the phone
G           D      Em                       C       D7     G    C    G
Right about then I wish I had known, they’d done, a big re-write.

G        D       Em              Am          C
I did my time, I paid my dues, I did my exit interviews,
     Em                D
Then turned around and walked away.
G        D       Em             Am             C
Tired of working for the man, I had a dream, I had a plan
    Em               C             D
And this time I’d do everything my way.
  Em                   Am        Em               Am
I launched the perfect   MVP, on-line for all the world to see,
C       G    Am         C                 D
Working in a new style, fast and lean and agile,
  G          D      Em               Am                 D
I tracked	 all my fea-ture requests, I built my code with unit tests,
    G         D          Em               C          D7          G
But then, one day... you know the rest. I did... the big... re - write
```
