```lyrics
Life is like a hurricane, here in tech world,
Deadlines, roadmaps, e-campaigns,
All those tech nerds,
Chasing that bonus,
Act like they own us,

Tech sales!
Every day they’re out there making tech sales!
Signing up and lining up train wreck sales!

When it seems they’re headed for that final contract,
Shady wording never fails, devs remain trapped,
The worst of messes,
They call successes!

Tech sales!
Every day they’re out there making tech sales!
Signing up and lining up train wreck sales!

C-c-c-commission! Global markets! 
They’re on a mission, hit those targets! 
That’s the reason they got into tech sales

Tech sales!
Every day they’re out there making tech sales!
Signing up and lining up train wreck sales!
