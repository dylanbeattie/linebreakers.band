  A
I first met Alice in a small bookstore"
D
  What book, - I asked, - are you looking for?"
E                            A           E
And she said: "a book… about monads"

  A
I understood, that's the key to her heart,
D
  I had no doubt, thought I was pretty smart,
E                                    A                 E
   I thought it would be easy, right from the start…

    A
I’m tired of believing all the things I gotta know,
    D
I’m sure that there’s a reason, someone gets it but I don’t,
         E                                                      A
‘Cos for twenty-four years, I’ve been trying to understand, the monads
        E
(audience: MONADS? WHAT THE FUCK ARE MONADS?)
A
Twenty-four years, just waiting for a chance,
  D
I have to keep on reading, maybe take a second glance
       E                                          A
I will never get used, to trying to make sense of monads
        E
(audience: MONADS? WHAT THE FUCK ARE MONADS?)


We worked together, on the same team,
Chasing the same, impossible dream,
To understand the monads,
Too old for rock’n’roll, now I’m forty-four,
But I still have a hope, if that’s the score,
That I’m just too young for monads..

I’m tired of believing all the things I gotta know,
I’m sure that there’s a reason, someone gets it but I don’t,
‘Cos for twenty-four years, I’ve been trying to understand, the monads
        E
(audience: MONADS? WHAT THE FUCK ARE MONADS?)
Twenty-four years, just waiting for a chance,
I have to keep on reading, maybe take a second glance
I will never get used, to trying to make sense of monads.
        E
(audience: MONADS? WHAT THE FUCK ARE MONADS?)

Slowly:
       E                 D                       A
I will never get used to trying to make sense of monads
