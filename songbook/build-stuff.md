Gm7                           
Work is driving you insane, ya know you’re,
F                         Gm7
Burning out, headed for a fall,
Gm7
Time to take a trip to Lithuania
F                             Gm7
  We have got the cure for it all,

                Cm7          Dm7         Gm7
You’re going to Build Stuff, baby, believe it

Come out to Build Stuff, we’ll see you tonight,
          Cm7          Dm7      Gm7
You gotta Build Stuff, baby, we mean it
Cm7                           Dm7                  Bb Cm7
   Gotta go to Build Stuff, / Gonna make it alright

   D7+9           Gm7       Bb - Cm7   D7+9           Gm7

Forget your frustration, find your inspiration,
You don’t need to do this on your own,
Share the solution, join the revolution,
Get yourself back into the zone.
