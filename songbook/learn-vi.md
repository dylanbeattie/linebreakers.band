```lyrics
Running through all of the changes,
This could take all night,
Think I need to edit a hundred thousand files,
Drop into a new resolution,
This one is too high,
Running out of memory on my Raspberry Pi,

Now I broke my X11 config,
Cannot open the UI,
Gonna have to fix this from the command line,
So I'm learning all the combinations,
Hacking like a samurai,
Make my way back home when I learn vi

Make a few optimizations,
How hard it can be?
Just a couple of changes to my dot vim r c
No more drag and drop, just s slash foo slash bar slash g
Escape double you queue bang will set you free

Now I broke my X11 config,
Cannot open the UI,
Gonna have to fix this from the command line,
So I'm learning all the combinations,
Hacking like a samurai,
Make my way back home when I learn vi

So long Sublime, farewell to VS Code,
Spend my life in insert mode, vi,
So long Sublime, farewell to VS Code,
Spend my life in insert mode

Now I broke my X11 config, Cannot open the UI,
Gonna have to fix this from the command line,
So I'm learning all the combinations,
Hacking like a samurai,
Make my way back home when I learn vi
```
