```lyrics
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh
'Cos if I'm gonna stay, I need the  key for the wi-fi,

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

They say it's kinda hard to get a job today
He doesn't have a clue but he works here anyway
He said he had experience with Angular and Go
But everything he does he looks up on Stack Overflow

[CHORUS]
He's poker faced, copy, paste,
he thinks you won't find out 'cos the names are all replaced
His code's a mess, he's got no tests,
He's on his way, to a zero day,
You're oh so tired, uninspired,
But there’s no way that you’ll ever get him fired,
His dad's the new C T O
Hey hey, let him do his thing

He's built an application, he's looking real proud,
He's running it on premise 'cos he doesn't do cloud,
His database is bringing the server to its knees,
he says he isn't racist but he won't use foreign keys

CHORUS

Now his code in review, yeah, he says that it's done,
but his project won't built and we can't get it to run
he emailed us the source, we got it unzipped,
it turned out all his Java code was really JavaScript
```
