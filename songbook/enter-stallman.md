```lyrics
Make it work, make it run,
When your code is done,
Share it with everyone,
Bug reports, pull requests,
Nothin' now but stress,
This was supposed to be fun

All those issues open,
You're staying up late tonight,

Up all night, make it right,
Faith restored, all of this for no reward

Now your code's in the cloud,
Turns out that's allowed,
But you're not making a cent,
It isn't fair, they don't care,
Because they're billionares
While you can't pay your rent

All those issues open,
Something just isn't right,

Play your hand, take a stand,
Free software, doesn't have to be unfair


When my laptop goes to sleep, I’ll trust the world my source to keep
If I've corrupted all my files, I’ll just download and recompile,

You pay for your iPhone, pay for your Mac,
What about the server stack?
All the code in your machine,
In your kernel, on your screen

Play your hand, take a stand,
Free software, doesn't have to be unfair




OLDER VERSION that I don't like any more:

MIT, GPL,
Choosing can be hell,
But any’s better than none,

Keep your license open,
And make sure it's watertight

Exercise, open rights,
Understand, software isn’t contraband


Volunteers, are our peers,
We need their ideas,
If this thing’s gonna work,
If you’re rude, or misconstrued,
Check your attitude,
Maybe you’re being the jerk

Keep your mind wide open,
We’re not here to start a fight,

Exercise, open rights,
Understand, this is not the promised land


When my laptop goes to sleep, I’ll trust the world my source to keep
If I've corrupted all my files, I’ll just download and recompile,

Don’t run Windows, don’t use a Mac,
GNU/Linux on your stack,
Open source on your machine,
In your kernel, on your screen

Exercise, open rights,
Take a stand,
Exercise, open rights,
Understand, software isn’t contraband

```
