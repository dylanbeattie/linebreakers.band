```lyrics
Make it work, make it run,
When your code is done,
Share it with everyone,
Bug reports, pull requests,
Nothin' now but stress,
This was supposed to be fun

All those issues open,
You're gonna be up all night,

Up all night, make it right,
Faith restored, all of this for no reward

Now your code's in the cloud,
Turns out that's allowed,
But you're not making a cent,
It's not fair, they don't care,
Because they're billionares
While you can't pay your rent

All those issues open,
Something just isn't right,

Play your hand, take a stand,
Free software, doesn't have to be unfair

When my laptop goes to sleep,
I’ll trust the world my source to keep
If I've corrupted all my files,
I’ll just download and recompile,

You pay for your iPhone,
Pay for your Mac,
What about your server stack?
All the code in your machine,
In your kernel, on your screen

Play your hand, take a stand,
Free software...
Play your hand, take a stand,
Free software, doesn't have to be unfair

```
