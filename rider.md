### Personnel and Equipment

**We use our own mixer** (Behringer X Air XR16) and in-ear monitors, with DI for all electric instruments. We ask the venue to provide AC power, front-of-house PA and wired HDMI for video playbacks.

We run the mix over wifi using a Samsung Galaxy tablet with Mixing Station ([mixingstation.app](https://mixingstation.app/)) software.  We're happy to give this to the venue engineer so they can run the mix on the night.

### Equipment storage and dressing room

Please provide a room at the venue on the day of the show where we can store our instruments, warm up, and prepare. If we’re able to leave some of our equipment there overnight after the show and retrieve it the next day that would be useful, but if not possible we’ll take everything away with us on the night.
