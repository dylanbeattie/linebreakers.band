Linebreakers on stage at NDC London 2023

> **The Linebreakers is a loud rock band.** We perform software and technology-themed parody versions of classic rock songs with video playback. This rider is our best-case scenario: we are flexible! If we get everything listed here, that makes for a really great show – great sound, great visuals, lots of fun for everybody. We are used to playing in venues that don’t normally host live music. We travel with portable USB mixers, wireless mics, cables & adaptors, and we’re extremely flexible as long as we have a bit of time to figure it all out. We’ve played shows before where the only AV available at the venue was a projector and a stereo jack to the PA system, and it sounded pretty good. As long as the audience can see us, see the video, and hear the music, we can put on a good show.

Equipment storage and dressing room
Please provide a room at the venue on the day of the show where we can store our instruments, warm up, and prepare. If we’re able to leave some of our equipment there overnight after the show and retrieve it the next day that would be useful, but if not possible we’ll take everything away with us on the night.
