```lyrics
Oh we were all looking for things to inspire us,
When it was all shut down by coronavirus,
Now we're in lockdown, 
And nobody is coming round,

We've taken all the regulations to heart, 
We got to stay at least a metre apart,
Wear a mask, wash your hands, 
Say goodbye to all your plans.

Oh, do you recall, 
The jet lag and long haul,
The world felt very small,
Then it all slowed to a crawl 
You know I really missed you all... 

Let's all meet up in two thousand twenty,
Turn on your webcam and your microphone,
We can still get together, 
Even though we're home alone,
Let's all pretend that this isn't weird,
Certainly better than drinking on our own,
You might lose inhibitions but 
you won't lose your phone.

I've been trying to keep up with the news,
But all the guidance leaves me scared and confused,
I've got the melancholy corona blues,
And I've forgotten how to put on my shoes,

Remember when I said I wanted a break,
That all the travel might have been a mistake,
Then we were all grounded, 
Not as much fun as it sounded,

Oh, do you recall, 
The jet lag and long haul, 
The world felt very small,
Then it all slowed to a crawl
You know I really missed you all... 

Let's all meet up in two thousand twenty,
Turn on your webcam and your microphone,
We can still get together, 
even though we're home alone,

Let's all pretend that this isn't weird,
Certainly better than drinking on our own,
You might lose inhibitions but 
you won't lose your phone.

What are you going to do on Monday,
Same thing as Saturday and Sunday,
Everything blurs into one day, oooooh,
What are you going to do on Monday,
Same thing as Saturday and Sunday,
Everything blurs into one day, ooooh...
