[Intro] 
Cm

Cm                     Gm
There's a requirement, on top of my stack,
Bb                       Gm             Bb
Seeking enlightenment, I message you on Slack,
Cm             Gm
I don't see why we're waiting to go live
Bb                                    Gm                     Bb
Our funding ran out months ago, we're struggling to survive 

Cm                    Gm
Nobody needs all this shit you're specifying
Bb                              Gm             Bb
Developers are burning out, the CFO is crying
Cm             Gm
There's a fire starting in my heart
Bb                               Gm                       Bb
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
G#              Bb                   Gm
   The scars of your love, remind me of us
             G#                          Bb G#
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             Bb                       Gm
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
             G7#5
I can't help feeling...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                     Cm                             Bb
We could have had it all... (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
               G#                          G#             Bb
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (Bb)                                          Cm            Bb
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           G#                                          G#                  Bb
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
 
 
[Verse]
 
Cm              Gm
Baby, I have no story to be told,
    Bb                             Gm                        Bb
But I've heard one on you. Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Cm                 Gm
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Bb                         Gm                        Bb
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
G#              Bb                   Gm
   The scars of your love, remind me of us. (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
             G#                             G#
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
             Bb                       Gm
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
             G7
I can't help feeling... (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                     Cm                              Bb
We could have had it all...  (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
               G#                          G#             Bb
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (Bb)                                          Cm            Bb
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           G#                                          G#                  Bb
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
 
 
[Interlude]
 
(Bb)               G#    Bb
Could have had it all
               Cm     Bb
Rolling in the deep
                   G#            G#
You had my heart inside of your hand
           Bb                 Bb
But you played it    with a beating
 
 
[Verse]
 
N.C.
Throw yourself through every open door (Whoa)
 
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Whoa-uh)
Cm
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Cm                     Bb
(You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
                     G#                         G#             Bb
We could have had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
   (Bb)               Cm                               Bb
We could have had it all yeah (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
   G#                  G#                                        Bb
It all,   It all,   It all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 
   (Bb)               Cm                          Bb
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
               G#                          G#             Bb
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (Bb)                                    Cm            Bb
You had my heart (you're gonna wish you) Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           G#                                    G#                  Bb
And you played it (Tears are gonna fall) To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
 
   (Bb)               Cm                          Bb
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
               G#                          G#             Bb
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (Bb)                                    Cm            Bb
You had my heart (you're gonna wish you) Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           G#                            G#
But you played it. You played it. You played it.
       Bb            Cm
You played it to the beat.

     Bm    A    C#

Nobody needs, all this shit you're specifying
Developers are burning out, the CFO is crying,
All these requirements, sat here on my stack,
No way we'll ship them all while we're still in the black

The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
You keep saying, we’ve gotta have it all,
The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
I can’t help thinking…

We ought to cut ‘em all (haven't got a clue)
Fight the feature creep, (what is MVP)
Right from the start we tried, had a plan (like a waterfall)
But you say it’s incomplete (features gonna creep)

Maybe I don't know what we should have done,
But our nearest competitor just shipped their version 1,
It doesn't run on blockchain, scan Facebook for your friends
They hit a million signups in their opening weekend,

Cut your road map, cut it to the bone
Nobody cares if we run on Windows Phone
Nobody’s buying, the vision that you sold,
Maybe time to pick up the agile manifesto
