```lyrics
     Bm    A    C#
There's a requirement, on top of my stack,
Seeking enlightenment, I message you on Slack,
I don't see why we're waiting to go live
Our funding ran out months ago, we're struggling to survive 

Nobody needs, all this shit you're specifying
Developers are burning out, the CFO is crying,
All these requirements, sat here on my stack,
No way we'll ship them all while we're still in the black

The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
You keep saying, we’ve gotta have it all,
The project backlog’s a hundred miles long,
I can’t help thinking…

We ought to cut ‘em all (haven't got a clue)
Fight the feature creep, (what is MVP)
Right from the start we tried, had a plan (like a waterfall)
But you say it’s incomplete (features gonna creep)

Maybe I don't know what we should have done,
But our nearest competitor just shipped their version 1,
It doesn't run on blockchain, scan Facebook for your friends
They hit a million signups in their opening weekend,

Cut your road map, cut it to the bone
Nobody cares if we run on Windows Phone
Nobody’s buying, the vision that you sold,
Maybe time to pick up the agile manifesto
