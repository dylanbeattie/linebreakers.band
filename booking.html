	<h2>How to book The Linebreakers</h2>
	<p>So... you're running some sort of tech event. A conference,
		a geek festival, your company's having a tech day, that kind of
		thing, and you think our band would make a good addition to your
		event. Here's how to make that happen.</p>
	<p>We do this for fun, but that doesn't mean we can afford to do it
		for free. Every song we play represents at least a week of writing,
		video production, and rehearsal, and we got bills to pay just
		like everybody else.</p>
	<h3>First: Are You Sure?</h3>
	<p>We're a loud rock band. We've played gigs in conference rooms,
		offices, theatres, but our best shows are in clubs and bars,
		later in the evening, when everybody's had a chance to take their
		laptop back to the hotel, have a shower, grab some food and a beer,
		and they're in the mood for a party.</p>
	<p>If you want an hour of polite background music while people drink
		wine and eat canapés, we are not the band for your event. Sorry.</p>
	<p>But if you want the loud rock show, and you've got a venue and
		an audience that you think are up for it, here's how it works.</p>
	<h3>Tech Rider and Requirements</h3>
	<p>Please take a look at our <a href="/rider">tech rider</a>. This
	outlines what you'll need to provide and what we'll need at the venue
	to be able to do the show.</p>
	<hr />
	<h3>Option 1: Give Us €25,000</h3>
	<p>We don't normally work this way, but if you just want the show,
		if the dates work, and if you've got budget, we'll probably
		do it for €25K. That's way cheaper than Coldplay, and
		<em>none</em> of their songs are about JavaScript.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h3>Option 2: Book Us as Speakers, Get A Free Show</h3>
	<p>This band exists because a bunch of talented performers kept
		bumping into each other at the same tech events and eventually
		figured since we were all there anyway we might as well put a
		band together. Some of us are at those events because we're
		professional speakers who make our living from keynotes and workshops.
		Some of us are developer advocates who do conferences as part of
		our job. Some of us just like going places and meeting people.</p>
	<p>We're all experienced speakers who can deliver sessions on a
		range of topics related to software development, architecture,
		the web, and more.</p>
	<p>At a bare minimum, be prepared to cover travel and accommodation
		costs for everybody you're bringing in.</p>
	<p>Many of us are keynote speakers who typically charge around €5000
		to speak at an event. Whether we would charge that to speak at
		<em>your</em> event depends who you are, what kind of event it is,
		whether we get to visit somewhere fun, who else is going to be there,
		and if anybody else is making serious money out of it.
	</p>
	<p>Just so we're clear: you are not inviting us to <em>submit</em>.
		You are inviting us to <em>speak</em>. Don't ask the whole band to
		put talks in Sessionize and then reject them all three months later.
		That's not cool.</p>
	<h4>So Who Do We Book?</h4>
	<p>First, you need <a href="/people#dylanbeattie">Dylan Beattie</a>. No Dylan, no show.
		If you just book Dylan, you'll get two hours of heavy rock music,
		with live vocals and guitar and everything else coming from playbacks,
		and it'll be a great show because he's a damn professional but deep
		inside he'll be sad 'cos none of his friends are there.</p>
	<p>Then there's <a href="/people#heather-downing">Heather Downing</a>,
		<a href="/people#mark-rendle">Mark Rendle</a>, <a href="/people#vagif-abilov">Vagif Abilov</a>,
		<a href="/people#hannes-lowette">Hannes Lowette</a>,
		and <a href="/people#eli-holderness">Eli Holderness.</a>
		They each add a unique musical facet to the show, so if you want
		to add disco, pop-punk, Taylor Swift, and Adele to the mix,
		best invite them along too.
	</p>
	<p>Then there's the wall of guitars:
		<a href="/people#kevlin-henney">Kevlin Henney</a>,
		<a href="/people#alex-dunn">Alex Dunn</a>, and
		<a href="/people#max-arshinov">Max Arshinov</a>.
		They're great players, great speakers, and having them along
		makes for a great show, but if you don't have the budget -- or
		the stage space -- for the whole gang, we understand.
